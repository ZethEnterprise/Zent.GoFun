Hello fellow Nerdies!

So. Let's take a look at the first project you'll ever make in Go... It is almost a natural law that the first thing you'll do is a "Hello World" project.
To be honest - why the heck do we do that? Why not make something more interesting. Anywho.

This project was the first one I encountered A "hello World" project (sigh - "Go with the flow, man!").
The source is this one: https://gobyexample.com/hello-world

So basically it is just use the same code as on the web page and then run these commands.
I was kinda a rebel and used a different name.
--------------------------------
|$ go run Hello.go             |
|hello world                   |
|                              |
|$ go build Hello.go           |
|$ ls                          |
|Hello   Hello.go              |
|                              |
|$ ./Hello                     |
|hello world                   |
--------------------------------

Now that was not - not at all challanging. I think the most challanging I had in this Go project was actually setting Go up in a profile to be loaded every time, but that's a different story.
And then again. We could always talk about ways to play with Linux profiles, which could be loaded in and make sure that your Go profile will not be loaded in multiple times.

But now => To the next project, which is "Hello World" in a Docker Container. Why you might ask? The answer is simple: "Because I can :D"
