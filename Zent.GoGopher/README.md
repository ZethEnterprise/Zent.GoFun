Hello fellow Nerdies!

So, in order to get my GoGui to work I needed the correct Gopher server thingy. But looking further into this I finally chose to set this project on pause as I needed to actually do the same
work as Scaly did. So in other words - I have to try to make the same example - just in the never version of Golang. That is going to be fun - challanging to say the least.
