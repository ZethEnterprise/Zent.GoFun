# Zent.GoFun
This is a Git Repo with various Go projects in order to learn and understand what Go is

Hello Fellow Nerdies!
This repo is aout my journey through the Go universe. so basically just me playing around looking into learning Go and making up small fun projects just for the hell of it.

So, to begin the journey I've installed the Go from this page: https://go.dev/doc/install

I know there is actually a Linux install command for it:

$ sudo apt-get install golang (something, something)

But that is no fun - and perhaps also my sellingpoint: It is Go 1.19 and I've just installed a Go 1.20 instead. So I think I will stick to my version.
Installing Go left me with a lot of questions (as I am still a novice at Linux and what nots, while being a bit nerdy&curious programmer). So I've ended up trying to understand the deeper
meanings of Bin folders and their locations and why they do have those. After a long time of debating with myself I found the perfect spot to extract the Go-code just to find out that the
"Go-commands" were not available in the terminals...(sigh)... So another "fun" problem to investigate, which led me to profiles. Added it to a profile while nothing happened,
do some more investigations in order to understand the meaning of the different kind of profiles and the possibility of making circular callings between profiles and how to get around that.
I had a bit of fun making a new profile, while working with environment variables to control, whether a profile has been loaded or not and what to do in that case. Still having some trouble of
making a "return" from a profile - but that is another story for another day (except if you got any bright ideas for me to try out :D).
